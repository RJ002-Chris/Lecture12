# Lecture12
## This is the start of my collab on lecture 12 exercise with Ryu
1. Both people make changes to README.md
2. Both people try to push up to GitHub
3. Try this multiple times and see what happens - get comfortable with merge conflicts!

My name is Ryu and I'm here to say, that I like GitHub in a major way!
